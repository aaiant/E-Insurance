<h2>E-Insurance</h2>

&emsp;About this Repo: **In my second year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Ovidius University in Constanța, I studied a subject called "Object-Oriented Programming". During this course, I had the opportunity to develop a small GUI project in Java Swing, based on a chosen theme. I chose to develop an application dedicated to car insurance.<br>
&emsp;The project aims to read users from a file called users.txt, verifying if the username and associated password are correct. Once authenticated, the user will need to fill in the corresponding fields, entering the name of the person for whom the car insurance was made. Subsequently, the information about the vehicle for which the insurance was carried out will be saved in the carsDatabase.txt file, while the details about cars and insurance prices will be written in a file called insurancePrices.txt. These prices are calculated based on several factors, such as engine size, year of manufacture, and fuel type. To run the program, access the Java class named Conectare, which is located in the package named interfață.**
